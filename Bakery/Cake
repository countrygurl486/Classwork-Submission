/**
 * 1) Locate the BakeryMain class in one of your workspaces. 

2) In the same workspace, create a Cake class. 
Do NOT generate a main method- that is what BakeryMain is for. 

3) In the Cake class, declare two attributes: 
a String called flavor, and an int called layers.

4) Create a constructor that has two formal parameters- 
one for the flavor, one for the amount of layers. 

5) Create another constructor that has one formal parameter- 
the flavor. Have this constructor set the layers to 1.

6) Create some functionalities (methods):

a) Create a method called "getFlavor" 
that returns the flavor of the cake.

b) Create a method called "getLayers" 
that returns the amount of layers.

c) Create a method called "setFlavor" 
that has a formal parameter, a String, 
that changes the flavor of the Cake to the input String.

d) Create a method called "tellIfTasty" 
that simply prints out "The cake is yummy."

e) Create a method called "incrementLayer"
 which adds one to the Cake's layer int.
