 * Make a class called ArrayListMethodsInDepth with a main method. In the main method, instatiate an empty ArrayList foods that stores Strings. 
 * Then add the following Strings to foods: "Apples", "Bread", "Cookies". 
 * After each task (except task 1) print out the length of the foods ArrayList.
 * Task 1: Print out the length of the foods ArrayList. 
 * Task 2: Inside of a print statement, add the String "Dole Whip" to foods. In the line comment for this code, state what it prints.
 * Task 3: Inside of a print statement, use the .set(E) method to change "Bread" in foods to "Butter". Comment what it prints. 
 * Task 4: Inside of a print statement, use the .remove(int) method to remove "Cookies" from foods. Comment what it prints.
 * Task 5: For each task, go back and comment what the method you are calling does, and what the method returns (both in general and in this case).
